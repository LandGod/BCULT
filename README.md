# BCULT
I created this one page website for a client through UpWork in a couple days based on a Figma design and responsiveness best practices. 

You can view a sample version of the page at [landgod.github.io/BCULT](https://landgod.github.io/BCULT/)

Project recieved [5 stars](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01b3a381f688771981/) from the client.
